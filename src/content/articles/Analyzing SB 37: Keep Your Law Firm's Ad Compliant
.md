**Transcript**:
===========================


**Ryan**: Welcome to the Cost for Case podcast. I am joined today by our new head of paid media, Fransisco. How are we doing today, man?

**Fransisco**: Doing good. Thank you for having me.

**Ryan**: So, this is a new podcast that we're doing. We're talking all about paid media for lawyers and really focusing on what matters, which is the cost per case. That's why it's aptly named. But today, we are tackling a topic that is very hot in the legal advertising industry. It's really only impacting California right now. We'll talk about why we think this is going to impact a much broader probably national level at some point, but it's called SB37. SB37 is going after legal advertising practices that are deemed, I guess, for lack of a better term, Fransisco, scammy and scummy, right? Which the injury space has quickly devolved into. SP37 came out only in California so far.

What do you think the impact of this is going to be? What is SP37 like layman's terms? Like what is it going after? What's it trying to clean up? What do you expect to see from this?

**Fransisco**: I expect this to see this to really clean up what lead sellers and case sellers are running in terms of their messaging. Like a really egregious one that we've seen recently is case compensation programs and then having a tiny little disclosure text on their website saying basically a referral service. You know, you have to actually have a qualified case to apply, which nobody's seeing or reading on those pages. And case compensation programs don't exist. They're just a referral service and they're selling those leads to law firms, running it to unbranded pages, unbranded Facebook pages. They're really trying to clean that up and also to prevent law firms from basically kind of dancing that line themselves. A lot of law firms forego submitting their ads to the California Bar Association. They're really trying to stop that and have people be compliant with their advertising.

**Ryan**: So, in terms of submitting ads to the bar, I mean, you've been doing this for a while. We've both been doing this for a while. Like, what is that process supposed to look like? Right. cuz we have clients come in sometimes they're like, "Do you submit ads to the bar?" And we're kind of like, "We don't do it, but we'll help you through that process if you want to." But it it rarely happens. Like, what does that process even look like?

**Fransisco**: I mean, typically you're reaching out. I mean, I think in Texas, they charge for it to a degree. And you don't have to submit every single piece of text or ad copy or imaging or video. I mean, if it's similar enough, you can submit a handful of pieces of ad copy and a video to get approval. But again, people who are doing it compliantly are doing this. But again, what it's really trying to stop are the people who are just by the seat of their pants testing whatever and saying whatever they want and then getting their compliance lawyer to write a disclaimer on their website.

**Ryan**: This is hyper specific. This is like a it's legal advertising, but really we're talking about personal injury, but even more, we're just talking about car accidents. You know, the car accident advertising space is out of control. You know, we're running millions of dollars of traffic in the space and we get all these ads. We're in Florida, but we get I mean Florida is probably just as bad as California, but like as soon as you show any sort of interest in a car accident, a car accident lawyer, you're going to get bombarded with these ads on Facebook, on Google, I mean everywhere.

And the claims that they're making, you know, like again, I'm not a lawyer, but I have a pretty good understanding of when an advertiser is blatantly lying. You see a lot of things like instant payout injury calculator, like not possible. uh you see a lot of just like guarantees around money claims around just around a lot of claims that are just factually untrue and most of the time they're not coming from law firms, right? They're coming from third party lead generation vendors or aggregators who run the ads, pay for the ads, and then resell them to law firms, right?

It's a massive business. We're talking about hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of leads being sold on a yearly basis easily. People don't realize how big this industry is and how deep it's gotten. I've seen a lot of PE firms that are actually investing into these companies. Uh, and SB37 to me is really going after that lead genen business model and being like enough. Like we have to hold somebody accountable because it's almost a loophole if you think about it from that um accountability legally point of view where like a lead generation vendor is not going to submit leads to the bar. They're not lawyers. Why would they? So, they're running these crazy claims.

And I use this analogy all the time, Fransisco, when I'm on calls with prospects about how like in the 1950s when Elvis first came out and started shaking his hips, everyone was like, "Oh my god, it's so impure." And now it's like, "Don't go on Instagram if you think that's bad, right?" Uh, and just and naturally what happens with humans is we normalize and things erode.

And we have watched this industry in terms of messaging erode so fast. I'm talking about in the last 2 3 years, I have seen the injury, accident, marketing, advertising industry erode so quickly in terms of messaging to the point where it's dangerous. And I think this is the government being like enough is enough. Like we can't let you just run this and make this much buu bucks off of it. And that to me is really what this is going after, right?

**Fransisco**: I mean, yeah. Basically, a group of law firms got together and said enough's enough and put together uh I think some kind of pact to really push this legislation forward. I think this is going to be a big win. We just had a client came on who has a cost per sign case of $5,000 in California alone. The most expensive that we see in any state in the country.

I think this is going to give a opportunity to smaller players to kind of wiggle their way in with paid ads. Again, I don't think that's going to be Google ads. The barrier to entry is still too expensive. But in terms of meta advertising and, you know, to a lesser extent, YouTube advertising, this gives an entryway for smaller firms to put up a modest budget and really take dip their toes into generating cases themselves.

And it's going to also drop the cost for larger law firms. Again, I think it's just good for the industry and I would like to see this move forward in other states. Again, just one of the big lead aggregators and sellers. They spend $5 million a month. 5 million. And that's just one of them.

**Ryan**: Yeah. We sign a lot of clients that are working with lead vendors or want to get off of lead vendors because you can't build a business like that, right? You can make money like that for sure, but the economics of those leads have kept going up just because the internet is one big digital real estate play. Meaning the more people that are involved, the higher the cost go. It's just the cost per real estate goes up.

And we have seen, you know, when you've been doing this for as long as I have, you've seen the lead generation model shift from SEO websites that were ranking and banking and selling to Google ads that were basically just again advertisers come in. They sell the leads. Affiliate schemes.

Facebook ads has been the the go-to for these lead generation brokers for the last couple of years. And on Facebook, you have a lot more ability to make these claims, right? Because you have video, you have images, you have landing pages, you have ad copy. You get AI influencers coming in and making fake videos. Hey, I was just in a car accident and I got paid out $100,000. like fill out the form below.

Um we've just seen that erode and blossom very quickly and the costs have gone up because um one of our other media buyers is in a Facebook group. There's 5,000 people in it and every single person in that Facebook group is learning how to do lead generation for a car accident running Facebook ads.

So you just think about it that way. There's a bunch of people from the marketing side who are trying to get into the business to make money because it's easy. Like you can walk up to any injury firm in the country, knock on their door and be like I will sell you leads and they'll be like at what cost? Like they're going to they're going to take that call every time.

Yeah, for sure. So, it's an easy sell. There's a lot of money going into it. And then at the top, you also have the Walker Advertisings, these really big lead generation firms that are spending pumping more and more money and they're getting investment from PE firms putting more and more money into it. So, the ecosystem is flooded, which means the costs have gone up.

So, when this first came out, we had some clients reach out and they were kind of freaking out and I I the more I read into it, I was like, "No, this is a good thing. This is going to lower your cost." Because I'm reading over here by the screen says you can now literally be sued by anyone, not just the State Bar. So that means the advertising companies and the marketing companies are the ones being held responsible. It's not really about the law firms. I mean the law firms fine, you know.

Yeah, of course they will.

**Fransisco**: You know, in charge of their own advertising. Again, I think it's going to be a really great thing for the industry in terms of like the lead aggregators and things like that. I mean, they have so much money. They buy leads from all kinds of individuals. And how how is that good?

If you spend a million dollars per month buying leads and cases for your brand, you're not branding yourself at all. That's a million dollars that is not going towards building your brand, building your own audience, and making people aware of who you even are. You know that you're just as transactional as can be.

They're basically turning it into their own like the lead aggregators are basically turning it into their own like Google ads cuz they're just auctioning off the quality cases to the highest bid, right? And that's why year over year you see that cost increase and get higher and higher and higher.

And what I mean, that's why in California you see like a cost per signed case from uh these aggregators for like $5,000. though. And you're you can't guarantee equality, right? You have those, you know, one out of 100 cases that turn into millions and millions of dollars. Who's that going to go to? Whoever's spending the most on aggregators, right? They're going to cherrypick the highest quality leads.

So, you're only spending 10 grand a month, 50 grand a month. You're not going to get as many quality leads and cases in the first place versus if it was your own ad spend, you have a chance of getting those big cases coming through.

**Ryan**: No, 100%. So again, like we both think that this is going to take a huge chunk out of the lead generation industry in California, which is the biggest market for MVA. I mean, I Texas, Florida, California, I'd say California is probably on top. Huge bite out of it.

We expect to see cost go down actually. Like I'm very excited. We've we get a lot of leads from there's more LA accident firms than Starbucks out there. It's crazy. We We got a lot of leads from We work with a bunch of them, but ultimately like we just couldn't get the cost per sign case to something that was stomachable because there's just there was too much advertising. There's too much competition.

And the way that the Facebook algorithm works is that the top spenders there usually get preference on the feeds and they're also making these claims where it's like we're working we work directly with a lawyer. We help you make the videos. Um we're doing everything compliant by the book, but it's really hard to compete when the ads competing are like, "Here's a big check for a million dollars. Like we guarantee that you can get this. Click this AI calculator to find out what your payout is." You know, like it's really hard to compete with that offer from like an attorney who's like, "Hey, I'm an attorney." You know what I mean?

**Fransisco**: Yeah. You can't say silly things like, you know, one of the most egregious ones I've seen recently is, you know, even if you're not that hurt or small accident, you could be entitled to six or seven figure paycheck. Like, how misleading is that?

**Fransisco**: They're they're just leaning into big checks super aggressively all the time. Or they're making up false programs to mislead people that there's some other program that you don't have to talk to a lawyer, you don't have to reach out to insurance, there's this secret little compensation program that you don't know about. Yeah. And they're just so misleading. all the time.

I watch their ads and see what they're testing. I recently just saw one of these big aggregators have changed all their messaging recently and I don't see that case compensation program currently and they were running it for months and months and months. So, I'm hoping that's a big reason why cuz they're running at a national level.

**Ryan**: Yeah. Just on that national level point too, I'm really hoping that this does roll out nationally because we have been very I say we but like we've been very admit for the past couple years that we don't want to sell leads.

I have been approached by you name the lead generation aggregator firm out there. They've approached us to to sell them leads or you know to even acquire us and I'm like no for a number of reasons. One, no. Just no. I'm not interested. And two, like the writing is on the wall.

I've been saying this forever. I've been begging and pleading with attorneys that buy, you know, we have clients that buy a million dollars worth of leads a month and they're they can't it's it's crack cocaine, dude. They they can't get off it. They're just shooting this up and like they're scared because they're like, I have a 100 attorneys on staff now or whatever it is that rely on these leads and like if these go it's a house of cards waiting to top of my entire firm. I'm going to go from $100 million to a million dollars in revenue.

Like it's crazy because they have no brand equity from those. There's people that have no idea what law firm there is. There was actually a study done by one of our clients. Very sobering study for a lot of injury law firms because the concept of brand is very misunderstood in the injury space especially.

And ultimately clients they know the attorney. They don't even know the name of the law firm after they ended up working with him, right? So, like you're you're like, "Yeah, I'm signing all these clients. They know who we are." It's like, "Yeah, but do they?" Like, they're not referring people over at that level of scale. Like, referrals come from other attorneys. Like, let's not lie to ourselves. Like, they're not really coming from as much, right, as from somebody who's in a car accident. I mean, sure, but like not on a level of scale that's going to sustain your firm.

So, point is is that I years ago hedged this and I was like, "No, we have to build this in house, which means we have to build a creative team. We have to do video scripting. We have to do video editing." Fransisco, you know how hard it's been and how painful it's been to build this team internally because Facebook ads are all about creative and we had to build that internally instead of just dumping money into like crap ads that we knew would generate leads and reselling them.

I'm a firm believer in building equity and building a business, not just making money. There's a lot of ways to make money in this country. Like this industry has proven to me that you can profit off anything, especially people's pain, you know, but there's ultimately a good message here that should be told, which is I'm going through it.

My house is a a roof uh my roof has a leak, right? So, I called the insurance company and now having worked in this space for so long, I could hear in the damn tonality of his voice. I knew he was going to deny and reflect. They put me through like five phone calls and I was like, "Dude, you know, I'm a busy guy. Like, what are we doing here?"

And they would sit there and be on an hour on the phone like reading me the policy and being like, "Oh, hey, you see this in the policy, you know?" So, I'm like, "You're going to you're going to bone me, dude. Like, I know it's coming. Like, I'm going to hire an attorney, you know?"

So, like, there is a place. But point is, there is a place for these attorneys. Like, you're not ambulance chasers. you're not like you're called an ambulance chaser because of the crap advertising that's been happening. This is actually a chance to take your brand back if you do it the right way.

**Fransisco**: And that's a really good point and I I really want to lean into, you know, we've had a lot of clients come on board and they instantly compare us to what they're paying for signed cases, you know, from these sellers and they're giving up within the first few months.

They're expecting us to compete with their multi-million dollar advertising that they have going on nationally across the board with all that data and aggregation. and they're expecting the same performance right away and they're not seeing it as building their brand in business, which is a really important point I want to focus on.

And because their intake teams are so used to getting prevetted and qualified leads who've already answered all their intake questions, their intake teams are not as hungry. And we see it all the time where not a single law firm that we've had come aboard uh will say their intake team is bad, but they're so used to just having pre-qualified prevetted leads that their intake teams aren't hungry.

They're not chasing as aggressively as they should because they're so used to it. And it's how how are you going to build a successful business if your your intake team isn't hungry, isn't ready to chase after leads? Because again, when they're on when they're on the trip and on the tap that they get lazy. It's not good for your business and your growth because again your intake team is your sales pipeline and they they get lazy they get lazy and they get spoiled and then you're expecting instant performance right away and that's not how any business is.

**Ryan**: Yeah, 100%. Again, I'm very excited. It's very bullish as like you know when you're when you're building when I'm building our business and and building this business and we're and we're working on this type of stuff and you know like the shortcuts were available for us to take and this is like huge validation for me.

When I saw this come out, I was like, man, this feels good. Because honestly, like I've been beating a drum with this for lawyers and they don't want to listen to me, dude. They don't want to listen to me. You know what I mean? Like, h yeah, but we're getting $2500 a signed case.

I'm like, you should be willing to pay more if that is coming through your own brand. You know what I'm saying? Like even if it's 100 bucks more, you know, whatever it is, like because we're building equity into your firm, into your face, into your name, and ultimately when, not if AI takes over, right, and people are tapping a chip in the side of their head like to recall what they saw before in the past, like that stuff's going to matter.

you know, like the money that you made in the past that you spent on that jet doesn't matter anymore. You know what I'm saying? Because the brand didn't stick.

So, um, so look, um, I don't know if you have anything else to add on on SB37, Fransisco, but this is something that we're actively taking care of. We have a compliance checklist internally that we use for our clients. Um we reached out to our clients in December, all of our ones in in California and started getting ahead of this with them and then helping them understand, you know, what are the things some of the things that they needed to get compliant in terms of um disclosures, in terms of the information that needs to be in the disclosure in terms of the type of content that they can publish and stay away from the messaging and who needs to be on camera.

There's quite a bit of information that goes into it. We have a checklist that we're going through if you guys are interested. If you're advertising in California, you need help with this. We've got a ton of experience with this. Um, and we've been on this for a couple of months now and we've got a process already done to make sure that all of your ads are compliant um, and safe and still working ultimately too, which I think is the most important part here.

**Fransisco**: Yeah, absolutely. And if you're already running ads, it's super easy to get compliant in California right now with your disclaimers. The hardest thing is going to be taking all those videos and just adding the, you know, small text into your ad, copying over the video, uh, and then adding the disclaimer on your landing page if you're sending it to it. It's it's a lot simpler than it than it seems.

Again, I I really expect this to be a great benefit to all of our clients in California.

**Ryan**: Yeah, absolutely. So, again, if you are a law firm in California and you're advertising, you're interested in advertising, um there's a link below this video. You can book a call with me. We'll go through the checklist that we have.

Um you know, as Fransisco alluded to, it's not nearly as complicated as one would seem. It's really just kind of about um making sure that you have the right disclaimers and disclosures on all aspects within the ad, within the video if you're running a video, and then on the landing page. Just make sure that that language is good.

And then also understanding that like if and you should be using video. The videos are also compliant with the messaging and the offers and the claims that you're making, which most attorneys honestly are fine with. They usually most of you guys come into this like knowing this stuff already, but you're buying leads from these companies that are just kind of doing it on your behalf.

So that's all we got this week. Um this is going to be a weekly podcast with Fransisco talking all about paid media, cost per case podcast. Make sure that you like and subscribe. Um and we'll see you next week.
