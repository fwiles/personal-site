I gave a guest lecture at USF’s Digital Media class yesterday and what an experience!

Big thanks to Professor Eric Ritter, M.A. for the opportunity to speak with his students about what it’s really like working in paid media and digital advertising.

I didn’t sugarcoat it. We talked about:
- The big wins and the hard losses
- Client pressures, budgets, deadlines
- Why learning outside the classroom is the key to long-term success
- Why it's important to network
- What skills actually matter
- Career tips and suggestions

There’s so much opportunity in this industry, but it rewards those who take ownership of their learning and aren’t afraid to test, fail, and try again.
